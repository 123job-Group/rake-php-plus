# rake-php-plus
Yet another PHP implementation of the Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction algorithm (RAKE).

This project is based on another project: [RAKE-PHP](https://github.com/Richdark/RAKE-PHP) by Richard Filipčík, which
in turn was based from a Python implementation: [RAKE](https://github.com/aneesha/RAKE)

As described in:

ROSE, Stuart, et al. Automatic keyword extraction from individual documents. Text Mining, 2010, 1-20.

This particular package intends to:

1. Add [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) coding standards.
2. Implement [PSR-4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) in order to be [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) compatible.
3. Add additional functionality such as method chaining.
